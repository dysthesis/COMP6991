1. - The issue is that the `if` branch and `else` branch returns different types (i32 and &str respectively)

2. - Set the type of `item` to `&dyn Display`
   - The shared borrow is necessary since we don't know the size of the value at compile time and hence cannot allocate it in stack.
     - Alternatively, Box can be used, but heap allocation can be more expensive.
   - Add a borrow to 42 and "foo"
